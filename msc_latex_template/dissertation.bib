abstract = {The CMS Beam Radiation Instrumentation and Luminosity  (BRIL) project is composed of several systems providing the experiment  protection from adverse beam conditions while also measuring the online  luminosity and beam background. Although the readout bandwidth of the Fast Beam Conditions Monitoring system (BCM1F—one of the faster monitoring systems of the CMS BRIL), was sufficient for the initial LHC conditions, the foreseen enhancement of the beams parameters after the LHC Long Shutdown-1 (LS1) imposed the upgrade of the system. This paper presents the new BCM1F,  which is designed to provide real-time fast diagnosis of beam conditions and  instantaneous luminosity with readout able to resolve the 25 ns bunch structure.}
