First and foremost, I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisor Nuno Filipe Da Silva Fernandes De Castro. I am also profoundly grateful to my co-supervisor at CERN, Andres Guillermo Delannoy Sotomayor, for providing me with the opportunity to work at the forefront of high-energy physics. His expertise, mentorship, and constructive criticism have greatly enriched my understanding of the field and have been pivotal in shaping this work.

I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the entire BRIL team at CERN for welcoming me into the group and for their exceptional camaraderie. Your willingness to share knowledge, the countless hours of fruitful discussions, and your patient guidance on every aspect of the work have been essential in helping me navigate the complexities of this project. I have learned immensely from each of you, and this work would not have been possible without your collective support.

Lastly, I would like to thank my family and friends for their continuous encouragement and understanding throughout this journey. Their support has been a constant source of strength.

Thank you all.
